When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one Stuyvesant ZR group to submit a competitor to the virtual finals, a decent respect to the coders at MIT requires that they should revise the faults which inhibit the performance of their competitor.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that we are the superior Stuyvesant ZR group. But when a long train of bugs and compiler errors evinces the flaws in our competitor code, it is their right, it is their duty to rectify suchs errors, and to provide new code for their future success. The history of our present code is a history of repeated errors and mistakes. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

It does not always prevent the opponent from entering the shadow zone. In the event that the opponent is successfully blocked, the number of points lost from penalties is not enough to compensate for the points they can gain in the given time.
It does not work against another team with code that uses the same strat (SteelInvadersAlphaTech)
It runs out of fuel. Often.
It is prone to flying off in random directions (SunspotsNarwhalsEagles) (MiraLomaNextGZeroBotx)

tl;dr pls fix
